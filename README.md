# RGB Color Selector

This is just a simple RGB color picker. Move the sliders to modify the red, green, and blue values.

You can view it on [Github Pages](https://ulitroyo.github.io/rgb-color-selector/).

Or you can view the original pen on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/UliTroyo/pen/jONqVLY?editors=0010).
